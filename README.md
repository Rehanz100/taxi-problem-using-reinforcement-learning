# Reinforcement-Learning--Taxi-problem
Training a taxi ( agent) to pick and drop a passenger from one location to another using RL.

The OpenAI gym library in python has various pre-built environment for learning Reinforcement learning. In this project, Taxi-v3 environment is chosen
#### Problem statement:
The problem statement is to train an agent which is a taxi that will autonomously pick and drop passenger in the given environment. 

#### Solution:
This problem was solved using Q - learning algorithm and then SARSA algorithm is applied over the Q-learning algorithm to improve it. Q learning algorithm is a greedy approach whereas the SARSA algorithm can be used to
make the agent explore. SARSA is also called as epsilon-greedy algorithm.
